        Developed by Riot Games—the visionary creators behind the global phenomenon League of Legends—Valorant is a high-stakes, 5v5 tactical first-person shooter that blends precise gunplay with unique character abilities. In every match, players are divided into two teams, with one side attacking to plant a rhythmic explosive called the Spike while the other defends to defuse it. For those looking to prove their skill, the Competitive mode offers a grueling climb through nine official ranks—ranging from Iron to the elite Radiant tier. Much like the strategic ladder in League, you must master a diverse roster of Agents and consistently win matches to earn Rank Rating (RR), pushing yourself to outmaneuver the competition and reach the very highest level of global play.

    <h2>
        Agents
    </h2>
    <a>In Valorant, the heart of the game lies in its diverse roster of Agents, unique characters recruited from across the globe by the secret Valorant Protocol. Drawing from the same character-driven expertise Riot Games used to build League of Legends, each Agent is categorized into one of four distinct roles—Duelists, Initiators, Controllers, or Sentinels—ensuring every player finds a playstyle that fits their strengths.
    <p> Whether you are leading the charge with aggressive abilities, gathering vital intel to scout the enemy, or deploying tactical smokes to control the battlefield, mastering an Agent's specific utility is the key to victory. To climb the ranks and prove your skill, you must go beyond simple gunplay and learn to synergize your supernatural powers with your teammates, turning every round into a creative masterclass of strategy.

    Maps:
   </h2>
   <p>
    Across the global battlefield of Valorant, the maps serve as much more than just a backdrop; they are intricate tactical puzzles designed by Riot Games with the same strategic depth found in League of Legends. While most maps feature the traditional two-site layout for planting the Spike, others introduce a unique three-site design that forces players to spread their defenses and adapt their utility across a larger area. Whether you are holding a narrow choke point as a defender or executing a complex site-take as an attacker, understanding how to navigate these diverse environments and their interactive mechanics is essential to outsmarting the opposition. To consistently win rounds and climb to the highest rank, you must master the specific angles and callouts of every map, turning the terrain itself into your greatest competitive advantage.
